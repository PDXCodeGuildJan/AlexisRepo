# README FOR ANGRY DICE GAME

# Introduction

This **program** is a single-player, computerized version of the game Angry Dice, based upon the original game of the same name that uses physical dice with two players competing simultaneously. Written in Python 3, the purpose of this project was to complete a course assignment for my PDX Code Guild Boot Camp, utilizing the concepts covered thus far in class, such as basic Pythonic coding, Classes. and modularization. The player can run the program in his/her terminal with Python 3. The program offers the option to view a list of rules/instructions in case the player is new to Angry Dice. The program virtually rolls the two dice randomly for the player, alerts the player to the current stage, and allows the player the option to lock a die in the event the die is of lockable value as dictated by the current stage.

# Specific Rules

Basically, it is a single player game in which the player rolls two 6-sided dice to match the specified criteria through 3 different stages, winning once completing the third stage. Stage 1 requires rolling a 1 and 2, Stage 2 rolling an Angry Face (which replaces the 3) and a 4, and Stage 3 rolling a 5 and 6. The player has the option of locking a die if the value matches one of the required dice values with any value except 6. Rolling a pair of Angry Dice at any point will make you start over at Stage 1. The player wins the game upon completing all three stages and then has the option to play again or quit the game.



# Dependencies

The program is written in Python 3 and thus requires that, as well as a Terminal or other shell, in order to run.

# Configuration

No configuration needed, assuming the player is familiar with using a shell and has Python 3 on his/her computer.

# Deployment

In order to play Angry Dice, open the computer's Terminal/shell and open the program with Python 3. The program is strictly for entertainment purposes/a potential portfolio piece.
